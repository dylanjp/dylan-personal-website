The Seven Atrocities are the 7 most powerful servants of the Dark Lord. They are normally cursed beings originating from the mortal world. Each one has a specific symbol branded onto them that corresponds with which atrocity they are. There have been several different characters that have held each position at different times in history.

**List of Atrocities**

(Wrath) *The One Who Hates*  - Love turns to hate when the heart loses faith
Wielders: [[Daken]]
Hatred and vengeful fury are central to **Wrath**, which embodies uncontrolled anger, violence, or malice. This character might seek destruction or punishment.

(Lust) *The One Who Craves* - Power is the worst kind of addiction - Shadow Knight
Wielders: [[Koe]]
**Lust** is not limited to sexual desire—it can represent an insatiable craving for power, pleasure, or obsession. This character is driven by unchecked, addictive longing.

(Greed) *The One Who Takes* - Robbed of their Time / Stealing Life Spans / Making Deals
Wielders: ???
**Greed** revolves around hoarding, theft, or exploitation. This character might steal resources, attention, or power, never satisfied with what they have.

(Envy) *The One Who Hunts* - Shadow Covets Light - The Dark Reflection
Wielders: ???
"*I see through your façade*"
"*Either I die, you die, or we both die*"
**Envy** involves coveting what others possess, often leading to sabotage or manipulation. This character "hunts" to claim what they feel entitled to, fueled by resentment.

(Pride) *The One Who Pursues* - Perfectionism
Wielders: [[Mara]]
This character relentlessly "pursues" glory, dominance, or validation, refusing to acknowledge flaws or limits.

(Gluttony) *The One Who Consumes* - The insatiable beast
 Wielders: [[The One Who Consumes]] (Raven)
 This character might metaphorically "consume" resources, experiences, or even people, leaving ruin in their wake.  

(Sloth / Acedia) *The One Without Care* - A lack of care or empathy - Artificial Intelligence
Wielders: AI, Evil Inventor
**Sloth** represents apathy, neglect, or laziness. This character avoids effort, responsibility, or empathy, embodying indifference to consequences.
